"""Main script for stone_wall.py"""

# You are going to build a stone wall.
# The wall should be straight and N meters long, and its thickness should be constant;
# however, it should have different heights in different places.
# The height of the wall is specified by an array H of N positive integers.
# H[I] is the height of the wall from I to I+1 meters to the right of its left end.
# In particular, H[0] is the height of the wall's left end and H[Nâˆ’1] is the height of the wall's right end.
#
# The wall should be built of cuboid stone blocks (that is, all sides of such blocks are rectangular).
# Your task is to compute the minimum number of blocks needed to build the wall.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(H)
#
# that, given an array H of N positive integers specifying the height of the wall,
# returns the minimum number of blocks needed to build it.
#
# For example, given array H containing N = 9 integers:
#
#   H[0] = 8    H[1] = 8    H[2] = 5
#   H[3] = 7    H[4] = 9    H[5] = 8
#   H[6] = 7    H[7] = 4    H[8] = 8
# the function should return 7. The figure shows one possible arrangement of seven blocks.
#
#
#
# Assume that:
#
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array H is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].
# Complexity:
#
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
