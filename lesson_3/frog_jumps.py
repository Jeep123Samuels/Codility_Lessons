"""Main script for frog_jumps.py"""

# A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road.
# The frog is currently located at position X and
# wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
# The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
#
# Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
#
# Write a function:
#
# def solution(X, Y, D)
#
# that, given three integers X, Y and D,
# returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
#
# For example, given:
#
#   X = 10
#   Y = 85
#   D = 30
# the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
#
# after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
# after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
# after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
# Assume that:
#
# X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
# X â‰¤ Y.
# Complexity:
#
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
